# What?
Just an `index.html` deployed to Netlify to test `iframe` integration of [Coopdevs community maps builder](https://gitlab.com/coopdevs/community-maps-builder).


### Develop
This will server the HTML in a localhost:PORT and build the CSS.
```
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

### Deploy
Just push to `main` branch. Netlify takes care of it.
